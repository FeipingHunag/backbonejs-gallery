## Backbone.js & Underscore Multi-level Client-Side Image Gallery Powered by JSON

Inspired by the store example by Elf M. Sternberg I decided to try taking this concept a few levels further by creating a multi-level Backbone based image gallery which supports album covers, albums and sub-albums. With three views this project aims to provide a lightweight, clean solution that can be used for personal projects easily [If I can ever get it finished!].

## Current Issues

Bookmarking is now supported on all depths *however* there is currently an issue whereby photos are being assigned new cid values when viewed multiple times, causing bookmarking to break. This is an issue I'll be working to fix. Code also needs to be made more DRY with respect to routing.
