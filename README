## Backbone.js & Underscore Multi-level Client-Side Image Gallery Powered by JSON

Inspired by the store example by Elf M. Sternberg I decided to try taking this concept a few levels further by creating a multi-level Backbone based image gallery which supports album covers, albums and sub-albums. With three views this project aims to provide a lightweight, clean solution that can be used for personal projects easily.

Bookmarking is supported on all levels and back-button support is currently working across on these across current FF, Safari and Chrome. IE testing results forthcoming. 

## Compatibility

Compatible with latest Firefox, Safari, Chrome (requires non-local testing), IE9, IE8, Opera 9.6.x, Opera 10.x, Opera 11.
