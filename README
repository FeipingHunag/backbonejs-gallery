## Backbone.js & Underscore Multi-level Client-Side Image Gallery Powered by JSON

Inspired by the store example by Elf M. Sternberg I decided to try taking this concept a few levels further by creating a multi-level Backbone based image gallery which supports album covers, albums and sub-albums. With three views this project aims to provide a lightweight, clean solution that can be used for personal projects easily [If I can ever get it finished!].

## Current Issues

Issue 3 with bookmarking closed. The status of bookmarking is that I've now moved over to Backbone's 'at' allowing direct index references rather than cid lookups. What this means is that subalbums and photos now have fully working bookmarks (which actually weren't correct in the last commit). You can now use index.html#imageid/1/subalbum/1 to access an image inside a subalbum however I might alter this to subalbum/n/imageid/m or something similar. Quite a lot of refactoring to be done within the codebase.

## Updates

We now support customized sorting on all levels. In order to set the current view's order for an item, all you need to do is set its 'pid' value. In the album view and subalbum view, this will allow you to define whether you want an album cover to be displayed first, second, third etc. It also means that you can define an array of images in no particular order then order them based on your needs. Note: an order *must* be defined otherwise you'll run into issues with bookmarking (however the basic views should still function)
